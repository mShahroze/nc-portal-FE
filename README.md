# The NC News Portal

This is a social news [website](add netlify url here) serving as the frontend to the NC-Knews [API](add heroku url here) for which the git can be found [here](add back-end 2 git here). 

The application allows you to post articles to new or existing topics and comment + vote on the articles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is assumed that VS code (or another appropriate alternative) runs on your machine. 

You also need node (at least v11.0.0) and npm (at least version 6.4.1) installed on your machine.

### Installing

#### Get the code

Fork the project from git. Then copy the git url and in the appropriate folder on your machine:

```
git clone <url from git>
```
This will create the project on your local machine. Open the project in VS code (or alternative app).

#### Install dependencies

Run the following to install body-parser, chai, express, nodemon, knex, mocha, pg & supertest. 

```
npm install 
```

Once all required dependencies are installed, you can check the node_modules folder (which should be created now) to see if the folders for each of these libraries exists.

## Running the tests 

Coming soon...

## Running the app

To run the app:
```
npm start
```
